"I am currently working on Cisco Networking online lab projects through the Cisco Networking Tools Academy. This experience allows me to gain hands-on practice with networking concepts, 
   including configuring and troubleshooting network devices in a simulated environment. It has strengthened my understanding of networking protocols, tools, and real-world applications,
   equipping me with practical skills essential for IT and networking roles."
